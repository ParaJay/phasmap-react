>6 metres from player: 3 m/s
2.5 metres from player: 0.4 m/s
Between 2.5 - 6 metres: Will gradually get slower as it approaches

Getting a Spirit Box response within 1 metre of Deogen has 33% chance to respond with unique heavy bull-like breathing

Appears to blink faster during hunts (visible for longer intervals and invis for shorter intervals)

If the Deogen is smudged or is otherwise not chasing any player, its speed will remain at either its previous speed, or 1.6 m/s, whichever is lower
