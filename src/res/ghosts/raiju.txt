Evidence: EMF 5, Ghost Orbs, D.O.T.S

Hunts from: 65% (near electronics), normal threshold: 50%

Moves faster when near electronics apart from the following: 
Head Mounted Camera, Motion Sensor, Sound Sensor
Video Cameras and Photo Cameras that are thrown on the ground
D.O.T.S Projectors that are held or thrown (not place)
Objects in  the inventory (expect Flashlights and Strong Flashlights if they are turned on)
Building/structure lights

Will interfere with electronics up to 15 metres away on the same floor (as opposed to the usual 10 metres)

During hunts if within a certain distance of active electronic equipment it will move at a fix approx 2.5 m/s
The ranges depend on map size: 
Small Map: 6m
Medium Map: 8m
Large Map: 10m
