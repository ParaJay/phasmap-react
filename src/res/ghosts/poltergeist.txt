Evidence: Spirit Box, Fingerprints, Ghost Writing

Hunts from: 50%

Has ability where it throws multiple items at once (creates EMF reading 2 although the thrown items themselves generate the normal reading 3).
This decreases sanity of all players near ghost equal to the number of items thrown x 2% (works even with lights on)

Cannot use ability if there are no items nearby

100% to throw an object within range every 0.5s during hunt (default for ghosts is 50%

Now has super throw instead of Oni
