If the Music Box is 5 metres or less from the ghost it will trigger a ghost event causing the ghost to manifest and walk towards the Music Box
If the ghost touches the player holding the box, walks for more than 5 seconds or if the box is dropped while playing music a cursed hunt will be triggered
If the player reaches 0% sanity a normal hunt will occur instead

The music box does not force the ghost to stop all activity

Listening to the music will drop the player's sanity
Holding the Music Box for the entire duration of the song will result in a loss of around 75% sanity
Sanity will only drop if the player can hear the song and the sanity drop decreases the further the player is from the Music Box
