Evidence: Ghost Orbs, Spirit Box, Ghost Writing

Hunts from: 60% (in the dark) or 40% (if lights are on, excluding equipment such as candles)

If a player turns on a light near a Mare there's a chance it will immediately turn it off

Higher chance to wander into dark rooms (if all lights are off it will seemingly travel forever)

More likely to choose turning off lights as interaction

Cannot turn on lights

More likely to choose a Ghost Event where light bulbs explode
