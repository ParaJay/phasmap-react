Evidence: Ghost Orbs, Fingerprints, D.O.T.S

Hunts from: 50% target sanity (87% avg)

Focuses on the same player until that player is killed or has left the game

Using a paramic has a 33% chance of causing Banshee shriek or wailing

A Banshee will prefer to cause ghost events where it sings over other types of ghost events.

If all of the following conditions are met:
    The ghost event is a singing event,
    The ghost event is targeted towards the hunt target, and
    The hunt target causes the Banshee to disappear prematurely (by going near it);
Then the hunt target's sanity will decrease by 15%, instead of the usual 10%

Banshees only check target's sanity for initiating a hunt

Ability: when roaming, if target is inside the map, has 66% to roam in target's direction (more frequent than Phantom's ability)
