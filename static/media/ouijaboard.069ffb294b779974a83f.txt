Activating the Ouija Board will cancel the setup phase

If the player walks 5 metres away from an activated Ouija Board or if they don't have enough sanity to ask a question the board will break and trigger a cursed hunt

If a question is recognised an EMF 2 reading will be generated. If the ghost has EMF 5 as evidence, there is a 25% chance to generate EMF 5 reading instead
